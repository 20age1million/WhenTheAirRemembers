            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              When the Air Remembers is an exploration of how London’s air has shaped the lives, bodies and memories of its people across
              eighty years. This exhibition invites visitors to travel through a timeline that stretches from the Great Smog of 1952 to the
              increasingly unpredictable weather of 2025, revealing how the atmosphere around us carries both the traces of history and the
              uncertainties of the future. Rather than simply presenting facts about pollution or climate change, the exhibition offers an
              emotional and visual experience that allows the invisible to become tangible.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              At its core, the exhibition asks a simple question: What does it mean for a city to remember its air? Through photography,
              physical archives, artistic installations and collected personal stories, we reconstruct a narrative that is simultaneously
              scientific, historical and deeply human.

            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              At the heart of the exhibition stands a sculptural installation we call The Weathered Lung. Formed from a piece of naturally
              eroded wood, its fissures resemble the branching lines of a human respiratory system. This installation embodies everything the
              exhibition seeks to express. The wood’s surface carries the imprint of time just as our lungs carry the imprint of the air we
              inhale. The piece serves as a metaphor for how the environment shapes both the city and the body—slowly, silently, and
              irreversibly.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              Visitors often pause before it, not to understand but to feel. It anchors the exhibition emotionally, functioning as a reminder
              that climate change is not only a scientific issue, but a bodily one.

            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              The exhibition brings together photography submitted by artists, students and citizens capturing London’s relationship with air
              in their own eyes. These images include quiet urban mornings shrouded in haze, portraits of daily life under heatwave warnings,
              industrial silhouettes softened by pollution, and unexpected glimpses of resilience in community gardens, clean-energy
              installations and moments of hope.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              Alongside these artworks, visitors can explore physical objects preserved from various decades—masks, filters, newspapers,
              medical tools, personal diaries—each one carrying a fragment of the city’s atmospheric history.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              A curated timeline threads these elements together, presenting not a strict chronology but a woven narrative of memory, breath
              and transformation.

            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              When the Air Remembers is arranged into four interconnected zones. Visitors begin with a historical corridor filled with
              archival materials from 1952, then drift into a contemporary visual field shaped by submitted photographs and environmental
              stories. A third space offers a speculative view of London’s future, informed by climate reports and public experiences.
              Finally, the central hall holds The Weathered Lung, surrounded by soundscapes, ambient lighting and subtle environmental cues
              that evoke the shifting rhythms of the city’s air.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              The exhibition is not designed to be walked through quickly. Its spaces encourage lingering, reflection and quiet conversation.
              It is an experience meant to be breathed, not rushed.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-900">Why This Exhibition Matters</h2>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              London’s atmosphere is changing faster than most people realise. The city now experiences record-breaking heatwaves, rising
              pollution episodes and weather patterns once considered rare. Yet these transformations often remain invisible in everyday
              life—felt only as discomfort, irritation or momentary inconvenience.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              This exhibition brings those invisible changes to the surface. It does so not by alarming audiences, but by inviting them into
              an intimate relationship with their surroundings. Art allows us to see environmental change not as an abstract crisis but as a
              lived reality. Through the emotions it provokes, visitors begin to understand why remembering the air is key to protecting the
              future.

            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              Our aim is not to instruct but to awaken. We hope visitors leave with a deeper awareness of the air that surrounds them—its
              history, its fragility, and the quiet ways it shapes the body and the city. If you find yourself noticing the sky differently,
              or sensing a weight in the air that you hadn’t paid attention to before, then the exhibition has already succeeded.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              The story of London’s air is not finished. It continues with every breath, every year, every shift in weather. We invite you to
              step into this story, to feel its layers, and to carry its memory forward.

              Visiting When the Air Remembers is designed to be an experience that unfolds slowly, the way a memory resurfaces. The exhibition
              is hosted at the Science Museum in South Kensington, one of London’s most accessible and culturally vibrant areas. Whether you
              are coming alone, with friends, or as part of a class or community group, planning your visit will help you make the most of
              the atmosphere, the artworks and the moments of reflection that the exhibition invites.

            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              The exhibition runs from 15 to 30 June 2026 and is open every day from 10:00 to 18:00. You are welcome to arrive at any time
              during opening hours, as the experience does not require a timed entry. Weekday afternoons tend to be quieter, offering more
              space to linger around the artworks, while weekends often bring a more lively flow of visitors and conversations.

            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              The exhibition takes place inside the Science Museum in South Kensington, a short walk from South Kensington Underground
              Station. The area is well served by the District, Circle and Piccadilly lines, as well as numerous bus routes. For those
              arriving from other parts of London, the museum is a straightforward journey from major transport hubs. The surrounding
              neighbourhood is filled with cafés, galleries and gardens, making it easy to spend a full day exploring.

            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              Upon entering the museum, signs will guide you toward the exhibition hall. The journey begins with a quiet historical space
              where the story of the 1952 Great Smog unfolds through objects, documents and sensory atmosphere. Visitors then move into
              brighter, more contemporary rooms filled with photography submitted by artists, students and citizens. The final section opens
              into a contemplative space where the Weathered Lung installation waits in the centre, illuminated so that its cracked surface
              can be examined from all sides.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
              Most visitors spend between forty minutes and an hour inside, though many choose to stay longer, especially in the central
              installation room, where sound and lighting shift subtly to evoke the rhythms of London’s air.

              The exhibition opens on 15 June with a short ceremony featuring brief remarks from the curatorial team and several participating
              artists. The opening day tends to be busy, but it is also the moment when the exhibition feels most alive, animated by first
              impressions and quiet encounters.

              Educational groups and community organisations are warmly encouraged to visit. If you are bringing a larger group, we recommend
              arriving earlier in the day to make the most of the space and to allow time for discussion within the exhibition. Teachers and
              group leaders may request a short guide or recommended pathway tailored to their subject focus.

              At the end of the exhibition, you will find a small reading area where visitors can browse through additional environmental
              materials, watch interview clips from participating photographers, or read personal stories submitted by Londoners about their
              experiences with air and weather. This space is designed as a place to pause and settle before returning to the noise of the
              city outside.

              Visiting When the Air Remembers is not just about seeing artworks; it is about stepping into a quiet dialogue between London’s
              past and future. We hope that your time here offers something meaningful—whether it is a moment of understanding, a shift in
              awareness, or simply a deeper breath.
